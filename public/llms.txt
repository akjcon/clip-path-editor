> CSS Clip Path Generator - Create complex clip-path shapes with bezier curves visually

## What This Tool Does

clippath.app is a free, browser-based visual editor for creating CSS `clip-path` properties. Users can:

- Upload any image as a reference
- Click to place points and create polygon or curved shapes
- Drag bezier curve handles to create smooth, complex paths
- Export the resulting CSS `clip-path` value in multiple formats (percentage, pixels, polygon, path)
- Preview the clipped result in real-time

## Use Cases

- Creating custom image masks and shapes for web design
- Generating clip-path CSS for hero images, avatars, or decorative elements
- Designing non-rectangular UI components
- Creating SVG-like curved shapes using pure CSS

## Technical Details

- Output formats: `clip-path: polygon(...)` or `clip-path: path(...)`
- Supports both percentage-based (responsive) and pixel-based values
- Works entirely in the browser - no server upload required
- Built with Next.js and React

## Example Output

```css
clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);
```

```css
clip-path: path('M 100 0 C 150 0 200 50 200 100 C 200 150 150 200 100 200 C 50 200 0 150 0 100 C 0 50 50 0 100 0 Z');
```
